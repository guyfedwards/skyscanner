# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
`styled-components` - CSS styling and extending backpack components. I am used to this library and way of creating components now so was the fastest way for me to style the app.

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?
`<yarn | npm> start`

(Default) `npm start`

---

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
Better more comprehensive testing with `react-testing-library`
I didn't address any accessibility
Some sort of interaction would be nice, currently it is just a static render.


### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
Guess I'm overall proud of how it looks and that I completed it well within the time. Most of the styling came from backpack and there wasn't any complex logic so was quite enjoyable.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
Classic developer situation of spending a while debugging something when I have not read the error message properly or a typo.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
Pretty enjoyable, haven't written much frontend code recently so was nice to have something designed that just needed coding up.,
Considering this is for a full stack role I would have expected something backend related to be included but was a nice change for me not to have to touch that.
